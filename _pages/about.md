I'm an incoming PhD student in the computer science department at Brown University. I (hopefully) graduated from Princeton University, where I was advised by the mathematical Matt Weinberg and the remarkable Mark Braverman. My research interests are generally in theoretical computer science, and I'm currently into online algorithms and graph theory.
  
Yeah I use github editor to make this
