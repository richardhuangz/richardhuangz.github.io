I'm a PhD student in the computer science department at Brown University. Before that, I graduated from Princeton University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/" target="_blank">Matt Weinberg</a> and <a href="https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Mark Braverman</a>. My research interests are in approximation and graph algorithms.
