I'm an incoming PhD student in the computer science department at Brown University. I'm ideally graduating at the end of the month from Princeton University, where I have been advised by the mathematical Matt Weinberg and the remarkable Mark Braverman. My research interests are generally in theoretical computer science, and I'm currently into online algorithms and graph theory.
