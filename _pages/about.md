I'm a PhD student in the computer science department at Brown University, where I am advised by <a href="https://dhershko.github.io/" target="_blank">Ellis Hershkowitz</a>. Before that, I graduated from Princeton University, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/" target="_blank">Matt Weinberg</a> and <a href="https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Mark Braverman</a>. I’m broadly interested in theoretical computer science, specifically in approximation algorithms and graph algorithms. I’m also into algorithm design in the context of incentives and uncertainty.
